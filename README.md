2022-04-16: This code is no longer being mantained.


# pelican-to-hugo

This is a minimal script for migrating [Pelican](https://getpelican.com) posts to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). It writes the post's front matter in TOML format. I wrote it for my own needs, to migrate one of my sites in a hurry. So expect some flaws like file paths being hardcoded in the script instead of using command-line parameters or a configuration file.

That said, I migrated my site to Hugo in a very short time using this small Python script.
